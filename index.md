# The Welcome Mat

Salt & Ink began as a kitchen notebook. A place to hold recipes, observations, and the small moments that revolve around the counter. Some ideas begin as recipes, others as sentences scribbled between steps. Over time, the notebook grew into a space filled with questions, photos, and stories, textured with spilled salt and spices.

It’s a living record of a home, and records are meant to be shared.

Step into the [Kitchen](/kitchen/) where you’ll find recipes, techniques, useful pantry items, and a focus on cooking as a craft.  

Take a look through the [Pantry](/pantry/) for ingredient reviews, favorite tools, and items that quietly earn their place on the shelf.

Then settle in at the [Table](/table/) for a look at the human side of food: memories, conversation, rituals, and the thread that binds us all together.  

Afterwards, wander into the [Journal](/journal/), a space of identity and becoming, the quiet evolution of self that happens through cooking.
