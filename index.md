# The Welcome Mat

Salt & Ink began as a kitchen notebook. A place to hold recipes, observations, and the small moments that revolve around the counter. Some ideas begin as recipes, others as sentences scribbled between steps. Over time, the notebook grew into a space filled with questions, photos, and stories, textured with spilled salt and spices.

<p>They say, “You are what you eat,” but the truth goes much deeper than that.<p>
  
  <p>You are the food of your childhood.

  <p>You are the people who share your table.

  <p>You are the quiet moments stirring a pot at the end of a long day.

  <p>You are the memories made over dinners.

  <p>You are the laughter shared over dessert.

  <p>You are the recipes passed down, adapted, forgotten, and rediscovered again.

<p>Salt & Ink lives in that space between nourishment and narrative, where food is more than sustenance. Here, recipes sit beside reflection, technique beside memory, and the table becomes a place to gather not just to eat, but to understand who we are becoming.<p>

  <p>Step inside. Stay awhile. There’s always room at the Salt & Ink table.

Step into the [Kitchen](/kitchen/) where you’ll find recipes, techniques, and a focus on cooking as a craft.  

Rummage through the [Pantry](/pantry/) for ingredient reviews, favorite tools, and items that quietly earn their place on the shelf.

Then settle in at the [Table](/table/) for a look at the human side of food: memories, conversation, rituals, and the threads that binds us.  

Afterwards, crack open the [Journal](/journal/), a space of identity and becoming, the quiet evolution of self that happens through cooking.
