Even when the chairs around the table are empty, the table holds the echoes of every conversation held across its expanse. There are faint rings on the wood from water glasses. There’s a scratch from when someone was a little too emphatic in their gestures with a fork. There’s some permanent marker stain on the corner and a little glitter from a long-ago Valentine’s Day project that won’t come out of the nooks and crannies of the table. The wood is warm beneath your forearms, worn smooth by years of elbows and passing plates. The table waits patiently for the seats to be filled and the lively chatter to resume.  

“Do you remember when Russ jumped off the roof?”  

“Tell me all about your college plans!”  

“Back in my day, we never cancelled school for a little snowstorm.”  

“Have I ever told you about the time when your Uncle Adam was bitten by a mouse?”  

Stories overlap, laughter rings out that can be heard all the way down the street. Grandpa reaches for another roll as he finishes telling a story about his hunting adventures. And every now and then, a question lands a little too heavily, and someone tries to steer the conversation in another direction.  

Gathering around the table is a ritual as old as the home itself. It’s where we talk through the ordinary details of our days, map out the week ahead, plan summer trips, and retell the same family legends until they feel like folklore. Plates are cleaned and the food grows cold, but the conversation stretches on because no one is quite ready to get up yet. If you want to understand a group of people, listen closely to what’s said around the table. The truth is always there, tucked between bites.
