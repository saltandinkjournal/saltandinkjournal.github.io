<span class="page-title">The Pantry</span>

<p>Opening the door the pantry is a sensory explosion. The smokiness of the paprika mingles with the tang of the salt & vinegar chips as you reach in to grab the dark chocolate morsels for your famous chocolate chip cookies. If your pantry is anything like mine, it's filled with a multitude of ingredients, spices, and snacks in such a variety of flavor profiles that you wonder how a cohesive meal could ever come from it. But this is where the magic happens. <p>

<p>What kind of olive oil should you keep handy?<p>

<p>What is the precise percentage of dark chocolate for the perfect brownie?<p>

<p>What's the difference between fish sauce and oyster sauce?<p> 

<p>When should you use cake flour instead of all purpose?<p>

<p>Is it really necessary to have six different types of salt in my pantry right now?  Probably not. But does it allow me to personalize my culinary experience?  Absolutely. Each one carries a story, a subtle difference, a little bit of magic that can turn a simple dish into something memorable. It’s a small indulgence that reminds me that cooking is as much about joy as it is about technique.<p>

<p>The pantry is an entire world of colors, flavors, textures, and scents, it tells the world who you are--and who you want to be. The pantry is a promise that even the most ordinary day can become extrordinary, with the right ingredients.<p>
