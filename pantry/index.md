<span class="page-title">The Pantry</span>

Opening the door the pantry is a sensory explosion. The smokiness of the paprika mingles with the tang of the salt & vinegar chips as you reach in to grab the dark chocolate morsels for your famous chocolate chip cookies. If your pantry is anything like mine, it's filled with a multitude of ingredients, spices, and snacks in such a variety of flavor profiles that you wonder how a cohesive meal could ever come from it. But this is where the magic happens. 

What kind of olive oil should you keep handy?

What is the precise percentage of dark chocolate for the perfect brownie?

What's the difference between fish sauce and oyster sauce? 

When should you use cake flour instead of all purpose?

Is it really necessary to have six different types of salt in my pantry right now?  Probably not. But does it allow me to personalize my culinary experience?  Absolutely. Each one carries a story, a subtle difference, a little bit of magic that can turn a simple dish into something memorable. It’s a small indulgence that reminds me that cooking is as much about joy as it is about technique.

The pantry is an entire world of colors, flavors, textures, and scents, it tells the world who you are--and who you want to be. The pantry is a promise that even the most ordinary day can become extrordinary, with the right ingredients.
